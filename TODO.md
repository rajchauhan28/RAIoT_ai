# To-Do List for Real-Time ISL Translator

## P1 - High Priority (Next Steps):
- [ ] Implement actual AI backend integration (WebSockets for real-time video stream/frame submission and translation reception)
- [ ] Add real-time audio output for translations (using Web Speech API or similar)
- [ ] Implement dynamic output language selection (English, Hindi, regional languages)
- [ ] Improve AI connection status (real-time feedback, retry logic)

## P2 - Stretch Goals (Future Ideas):
- [ ] Enhance error handling (e.g., specific messages for camera access, AI errors, network issues)
- [ ] Add user feedback mechanism for incorrect translations
- [ ] Implement session history for reviewed translations
- [ ] Introduce accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, high contrast mode)
- [ ] Refine UI/UX with more advanced animations or micro-interactions
- [ ] Consider mobile app versions (React Native/Flutter)

## General:
- [ ] Expand ISL dataset for improved recognition accuracy
- [ ] Optimize latency for real-time experience
